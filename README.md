Correction of the biases in the flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy

The code is to derive the correction factors for the biases in the flux-resolved X-ray spectroscopy. 

It can be simply downloaded and used as following: python correction_simulation.py obsid low_count_rate high_count_rate.

e.g. python correction_simulation.py 60301004002 0.0 2.5
